# Lesson 6: Introduction to Vue

## Why Vue?

Some of you may already know a bit about JavaScript frameworks, and if so, you probably know about React and Angular.

Before using Vue, I've used React to create some applications, including a mobile app using React Native. However, one major frustration I've had with React is that it's too verbose and that it's a nightmare tracking down bugs related to the dependency array in useEffect and similar hooks.

Vue is a much simpler alternative to React that uses some JavaScript magic to automatically track variables. This makes it much more performant and much less verbose than React. However, React is a lot more established than Vue, and thus you're more likely to actually work with React in your future than you are with Vue (at least, as of writing).

However, a lot of the concepts between React and Vue are similar. They share similar ideas like components, props, event callbacks, reactivity, etc. I ultimately chose to build the VPCI Clubs website with Vue because it's a **lot** simpler to learn for new developers, since it's heavily based on prior HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, whereas React introduces a lot more new concepts that you'll have to grasp.
